#Critter Care --- How to care for fish

#The Notes

##Overfeeding

To take care of a fish tank you cannot under/overfeed your fish, underfeeding is a way to get unhappy and hungry fish, but be careful, if you feed them too much you will get a biofilm which happens from food breaking down into clumpy proteins, which meet on the surface to form a layer which can be bad for the fish because if you don’t have a plant to photosynthesis, the layer could stop oxygen from entering the tank.

##Personal space

Usually you would follow what the internet says, but with our fish, they’ve been living so long together in the same environment, that each and every fish that usually wouldn't get along or was in the wrong environment, adapted to the new environment, and the other species that would've not gotten along well.

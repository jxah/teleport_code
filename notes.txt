How to care for fish

The Notes

Overfeeding
To take care of a fish tank you cannot under/overfeed your fish, underfeeding is a way to get unhappy and hungry fish, but be careful, if you feed them too much you will get a biofilm which happens from food breaking down into clumpy proteins, which meet on the surface to form a layer which can be bad for the fish because if you donâ€™t have a plant to photosynthesis, the layer could stop oxygen from entering the tank.

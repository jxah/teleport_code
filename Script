                          *Scout #3 enters and poses*
                        *Scout #1 and Announcer enters*
Announcer: Watch (Scout #1) as he/she preforms an increible act of atheticisim!
They will jump higher than this...
                                 *Looks around*
...This incredibly realistic statue of a scout!
                                *Points at scout #2*
                                     *Pauses*
                                  *Scout #1 hops*
Scout 1:I did it!...
                                     *Pauses*
Of course, a statue canâ€™t jump.
Scout 2: or can they? 
                                  *Scout #2 jumps*
